# Richard's First CS-193 Homework

#### My Favorite Things About CS-193 So Far:
- Led by students
- Teaches things that are standard in the CS industry, such as the unix command line and git.
- Informed me about Windows Subsystem for Linux, a tool which I plan to use extensivly instead of Windows' terrible command prompt.
- Doesn't take too much time out of the week
